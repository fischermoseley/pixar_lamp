# pixar_lamp

Design of a physical lamp that accurately matches the dynamics in Pixar's Luxo Jr. animation. Completed as a final project for MIT's `2.74 - Bioinspired Robotics` class. Simulation done in Drake, CAD in Fusion 360, and crying in banana lounge.

The associated Deepnote project can be viewed [here](https://deepnote.com/project/PixarLamp-X9jh03HCR9SHHH7tTis4fA/%2FPixarLamp%2Facrobot.ipynb).

The simulations borrow a lot of code from Underactuated Robotics (6.832), namely the [acrobot](https://colab.research.google.com/github/RussTedrake/underactuated/blob/master/acrobot.ipynb) and [direct colocation](https://colab.research.google.com/github/RussTedrake/underactuated/blob/master/trajopt.ipynb#scrollTo=1WdtfKmhu9us) notebooks.

## Version Control in Deepnote
Version control with this particular setup is a little strange. Deepnote is pulling a docker image stolen from 6.843 with Drake preinstalled, but it doesn't include `git` since it's not designed for active development. This is fixable by running `apt update && apt install git` in a Deepnote terminal, and then version control should work.

Since the GitHub integration is already setup, it should load your GitHub account details automatically and you shouldn't need to login.
